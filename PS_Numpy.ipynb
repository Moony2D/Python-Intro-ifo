    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Use NumPy's **random** package to get **N** draws from a standard normal distribution (google to get the name of the corresponding function and its syntax!) and store them in a NumPy array. Find the sample average and standard deviation for **N = 10**, **N = 1000** and **N = 1000000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) For the last case in question (a) with **N = 1000000**, use an index array or Numpy's **where** function to find the share of draws that is either less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96. What's your expectation what this share should be?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a two-dimensional 4-by-4 NumPy array **A** with elements from 1 to 16. A quick way to do is using Python **range** function and the **shape** method of NP arrays. Recall from linear algebra that multiplying any matrix with the identity matrix **I** just results in same matrix (i.e. $I \\cdot A = A \\cdot I = A$). Confirm this using your array **A**. What happens if you multiply **A** with an array of the same dimension that consists only of 1s?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Write a function **get_diag** that takes a *square* matrix of dimension **n** and returns a flat array of length **n** that contains the elements on the matrix' diagonal. The first thing the function should do is checking if the input is a square array and give an error message otherwise. You could this in many ways; one neat option is an **assert** statement (check the documentation!). Alternatively, you could use a print statement and interrupt the function with **Return None**."

    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you are asked to write your own implementation of the *bisection method* to compute the root of a real-valued function. Of course, most programming languages already have in-built implementations (e.g. in SciPy: **scipy.optimize.bisect**}, so writing your own function may seem a bit redundant. The goal here is to give you some idea about the inner workings of many of the algorithms used in scientific computing. The bisection method, while quite simple, captures two important features of most root-finding and optimization methods: it is a *local* method and it is based on an *iterative procedure*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that a root of a real-valued function $f$ is a value $x$ in the domain of the function such that $f(x)=0$. The idea behind the bisection method is based on the *Intermediate Value Theorem*: if $f$ is continuous and defined on the interval $[a,b]$, and if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are distinct values, then $f$ must assume all values in between. Since we are interested in where $f$ assumes the value 0, we need $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ to have different signs.\n",
    "- The bisection method implements the following \"pseudo-code\":\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Start with two values $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are defined and have different signs. Moreover, specify a \"tolerance level\" $tol$ which should be a very small number, e.g. 1e-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Compute the midpoint between $a$ and $b$, $x = \\frac{a + b}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) If $f(x)$ has the same sign as $f(a)$, replace the left endpoint of the interval with $x$, i.e. $a = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) If $f(x)$ has the same sign as $f(b)$, replace the right endpoint of the interval with $x$, i.e. $b = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(v) Repeat from (ii) until the absolute value of $f(x)$ is less than $tol$, i.e. $|f(x)| < tol$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bisection is an *iterative procedure*: at the beginning of each iteration step, the interval $[a,b]$ contains a root of $f$. The interval is then divided (\"bisected\") into two subintervals of equal length. One of the two subintervals must contain the root, and hence have endpoints of different signs. This subinterval is taken as the interval $[a,b]$ used for the next iteration. This process continues until the resulting midpoint $x$ of the current interval is sufficiently close to 0.  \n",
    "- Moreover, note that bisection is a *local* method: it will not give you all the roots of a function, but only one of the roots (in case there are multiple roots) between $a$ and $b$. A corollary of this is that the outcome of bisection (and of local methods in general) is sensitive to the starting point chosen by the user, here the values for $a$ and $b$.\n",
