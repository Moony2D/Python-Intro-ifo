    "Solve the model in the previous question (without the externality) numerically for a more general setting, in particular with a CIES utility function and less than full depreciation. Choose reasonable values for the parameters. How does the optimal extraction profile depend on the growth rate of total factor productivity?\n",

    "We can see that less than full depreciation and non-logarithmic utility, higher productivity growth leads to less investment and hence a lower capital stock in period 2. This is intuitive: recall that $\\nu > 1$ indicates a lower elasticity of intertemporal substitution (or a higher aversion to intertemporal consumption inequality), hence if the household is richer in the future (due to a higher productivity), the incentive to save today is weaker. A lower capital stock in period 2 implies that the marginal return to capital - $F_K(K_2, E_2) + 1 - \\delta$ - increases. By the Hotelling rule, this implies that the *relative* marginal return to fossil fuel in period 2 (relative to period 1) has to rise as well. This can be achieved by shifting extraction from period 2 to period 1, thus leading to a (albeit small) increase in current fossil fuel use."
