A function in programming does the same, with the difference that inputs and outputs can be anything, not just numbers.\n",

    "*Methods* are an important concept in Python, in particular in the context of object-oriented programming. Since we will not get into this in this course, let's just think of methods as a special type of function that can be used only on a particular data type. For example, lists have a *list method* called **append** which can be used to add new elements to an existing list. This method works only on lists, and would not work on sets or dictionaries. The syntax for methods is different from functions: *variable_name.method_name(arguments)*. This is illustrated by the following example:  "

    "In addition to the functions and modules contained in the standard library, there is a large number of *packages* or *external libraries*. Those are usually written and maintained by external developers and consist of one or more modules. If you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, many packages are automatically included, which means you just need to import them. If you have only the core package installed or if you want to use a package that is not part of Anaconda, you will need to download and install it first. For this course, we will use three packages in Anaconda: NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib."
